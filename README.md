 ALERTIFY Is a next-generation emergency response system designed to rapidly detect distress events using mobile sensor and deliver immediate, tamper-proof, and trackable alerts to emergency services, hospitals, and guardians. The system leverages real-time GPS tracking, ML-based shake detection, instant SOS alerts, and blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and verifiable data handling.  In our architecture, hospitals serve as decentralized hubs, receiving real-time emergency alerts and acting as response coordinators.
